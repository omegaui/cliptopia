## ![daemon](https://img.icons8.com/cotton/48/rocket.png) The Daemon
At the heart of Cliptopia lies the [`cliptopia-daemon`](https://github.com/omegaui/cliptopia_daemon) which is responsible for watching your clipboard.

When you install Cliptopia,
you can run it directly from the app launcher or by just executing `cliptopia` in your terminal or by pressing Super + V after you have created the clipboard shortcut.
In any case, cliptopia will ask you to install the daemon ...

Either you can download/build it from source by yourself from its [repo](github.com/omegaui/cliptopia_daemon) or you let cliptopia handle this for you. 
Yes, Cliptopia can itself download the daemon for you if you desire so.

Moving further, in any case, the daemon should be placed at `/usr/bin` so that cliptopia can manage it.

**Cliptopia is compositor independent** which means it works the same no matter you are on X11 or Wayland.
On X11, `xclip` is used to watch the clipboard and on Wayland `wl-clipboard` is used.

On some distros, like **Ubuntu with GNOME on Wayland**, xclip still works because of an XWayland session, so, if you want you can force cliptopia to use `xclip` even on wayland also from its settings panel.

#### Please note that Cliptopia is in beta until a stable version releases, which is expected to be released by the end of this month.

## Installation

Right now, you can only install cliptopia from source.

Before that you need the following commands available in your linux distribution ...

- grep
- java 17 or above
- xclip
- pgrep
- pkexec
- whereis
- wl-clipboard (for wayland only)
- and optionally **flutter** 3.16 or above if you are installing from source.

Yes, Cliptopia is written entirely using Flutter, thus, it compiles to native and delivers lightening fast performance as your other apps.

Installing Cliptopia is a very easy and fast process ...

-   Just Clone the official repo 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/omegaui/cliptopia
```

-   move into the cloned repo

```bash
cd cliptopia
```

- and run the install-from-source.sh script to install from source

```bash
./install-from-source.sh
```

Running the above commands in sequence will install cliptopia on your machine.

If you have already installed cliptopia, running the above commands will result in manually updating your installation.

## Keyboard Shortcut
Then, you need to add a custom keyboard shortcut to invoke Cliptopia in Power Mode ...

## Modes
Cliptopia can be made to launch in three mode:
- Normal Mode (`cliptopia`)
- Silent Mode (`cliptopia --silent`)
- Power Mode (`cliptopia --silent --power`)

Injection: it refers to clicking on an clipboard element in the UI of Cliptopia to insert it in the last focussed field.

### Normal Mode
- Updates in real time as you use your clipboard
- Supports content injection
- Does not quits after injection is performed

### Silent Mode
- Updates in real time as you use your clipboard
- Supports content injection
- Quits after injection is performed

### Power Mode
- Does **NOT** updates in real time as you use your clipboard
- Supports content injection
- Quits after injection is performed

There is a very valid reason Power Mode is designed to not update in real time,
as we know, Super + V combination can be used to bring the Power Mode into effect,
it is designed to be used occasionally when you require to find an item that you copied earlier and in cases, 
where you need to do this quickly. 

So, for the Power Mode to get ready in an instant, a single read of the cache is performed to deliver the fastest possible 
performance on your system, thus, preventing the real time updates as there is no watching of the cache being maintained by the daemon.

That's why power mode does not update in realtime.

But, We do not stop here, actually the Power Mode can be made to update in real time, by using the `--update` flag.
Work on this is currently under development. 

## Updates

Cliptopia will have a built-in update system, so, when a new release arrives, your installation will automatically notify you about it.

## Uninstallation

Cliptopia will even offer an in-app uninstall feature to uninstall cliptopia from your system in case you want a fresh install.
