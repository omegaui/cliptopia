# Cliptopia

**I recommend reading the application description on Project's [Slite Channel](https://omegaui.slite.page/p/SCCw4NaQYcBX1A/Cliptopia).**
**It looks beautiful and eye appealing.**

Cliptopia is a state-of-the-art **clipboard management software** for the linux desktops that turns your simple clipboard into a full-fledged ‚ö°**power house**‚ö°

Cliptopia watches not only your texts but also any **emojis, colors, commands, web images, screenshots or any local file/directory** that you copy and then, it provides a full-fledged powerful interface supporting advanced searching and filtering which even allows you to search any image that you have copied.

Before that you need the following commands available in your linux distribution ...

- grep

- and optionally **flutter** 3.16 or above if you are installing from source.

Yes, Cliptopia is written entirely using Flutter, thus, it compiles to native and delivers lightening fast performance as your other apps.

Installing Cliptopia is a very easy and fast process ...
